## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed .9005 from version number.

* Capitalized the word Tidyverse in the Description. This was in response to the following automatic check note: Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION: tidyverse (6:38).

* Added the vignettes back into the package. I thought removing them would make the submission process easier for now, but resulted in failing the automatic check with: Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index.

* Edited the title field. Previous version was: 'Make Quick Descriptive Tables For Categorical Variables'. Current version is: 'Make Quick Descriptive Tables for Categorical Variables'.

* Added continuous integration with travis-ci.

* Updated README to include additional examples of how to use freqtables.

* Added news.md

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.0
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 4.0.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs
